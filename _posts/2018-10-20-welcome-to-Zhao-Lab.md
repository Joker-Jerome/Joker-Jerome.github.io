# Welcome to Zhao's Lab

Our group develops mathematical, statistical, and computational methods to address scientific problems in molecular biology and genetics. The graduate students in our group are from the Department of Biostatistics at Yale School of Public Health or the Interdepartmental Doctoral Program in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at Yale. We collaborate with many research groups at Yale and other institutions on the biological basis and treatment of cancer, substance dependence, psychiatric disorders, aneurysm, hypertension, lung diseases, and others. We also collaborate with plant geneticists and evolutionary biologists using next generation sequencing and microarrays to identify genetic associations with various traits.
